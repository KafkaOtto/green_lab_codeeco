# Evaluating the Energy Efficiency of Code Generated by Llama 3.1

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the energy efficiency of generated code by Llama 3.1
against human implementation on code problems. We learn the energy efficiency of generated code by
Llama 3.1 from factors as problem complexity and prompt engineering techniques.

## Setup
1. To start with, you need to install Python3 on your system. If you do not have python, you can install from
[Python Packages](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Powerjoular following the instructions provided in [Powerjoular Repository](https://github.com/joular/powerjoular)
3. Install the necessary packages using
```shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Running

To run the experiment and generat the running table, you can execute the command:
```shell
python3 experiment-runner/ experiments/runner/RunnerConfig.py
```
